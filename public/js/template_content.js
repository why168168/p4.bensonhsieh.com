	'1.es': "The majority of hearing-impaired individuals who use hearing-aids or undergo surgery to receive cochlear implants expect to hear well. However, the reality is that tens of thousand of patients continue to experience severe difficulty hearing in the real world, away from the clinical setting. This is primarily due to the incorrect adjustment of the settings on the medical device by a clinician. Consequently, audiologists and speech therapists greatly need a hearing test that can quickly and accurately predict how well individuals, with either a cochlear implant or a hearing aid, can hear in a noisy 'real world' environment following installation of the medical device. Such a test is especially important for children, as early intervention can reduce slowed learning. It is estimated that if children with hearing loss do not receive early intervention, special education for a child with hearing loss will cost an additional $420,000 in special education costs and result in a lifetime cost of approximately $1 million per child.[1] In adults, hearing loss can begin as early as age 50 and lack of early intervention can lead to loss of jobs, emotional distress and even cognitive disorders. In addition, since life expectancy can realistically reach to age 90 and beyond, an individual could potentially be affected by hearing loss for half of his/her lifetime.",

   '4.ct': "Auris Solutions' CRISP hearing test system is protected under United States patent #6,584,440. As a brief description of the technology, CRISP hearing test is a method and system for testing the speech intelligibility of a child comprises providing a set of target sounds as words in the presence and absence of competing sound(s) of a variety of types so as to enable an analysis of the aspects of competing sounds and their respective effects on the speech intelligibility of a child. CRISP varies the locations at which competing sound(s) is provided, to enable an evaluation of the sounds' effects on the spatial release from masking."
           + "The target words used in the test are first determined to be within the vocabulary of the child. The child is required to respond to the target word by selecting a picture representation of the target word from among several picture choices, thus providing an interactive aspect to the test. Optionally, a positive or negative reinforcement may be provided. The sound level at which the target words are presented may vary adaptively according to the child's responses, the change in sound level being determined by a set of rules. The test is repeated over several target words and under a variety of types and locations of competing sounds, and the child's responses are recorded in a results database. Users may further analyze the results to produce customized output. The computerized system enables administering the test in a controlled manner, analyzing the data, and further engaging the child." ,

   '5.pd': "The CRISP test comprises target sounds as words that occur in the presence of competing sound(s), that are either spatially near or separated from the target. CRISP will enable the user to measure a child's ability to understand speech in the presence of competing noise or words, and the extent to which each individual child benefits from spatial separation of the target and competing sounds. In CRISP, the child is required to respond to the target word by selecting a picture representation of the target word from among several picture choices, thus providing an interactive aspect to the test. Animations and feedback will be employed to engage the child during the test as well as functioning as a form of positive reinforcement. CRISP provides a set of rules whereby the sound level at which target words are presented may vary adaptively according to the child's responses. The test repeats several target words under a variety of types and locations of competing sounds and records the child's responses in a results database. The results are available for further analysis by a user to produce a customized output. A computerized system enables provisioning the test in a controlled manner, analysis of the data, and further engagement of the child. ",
